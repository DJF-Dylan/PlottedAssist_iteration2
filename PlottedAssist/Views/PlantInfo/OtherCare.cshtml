                    Once you have established your sustainable garden, the next step is to know how to care for it through regular maintenance. This section will provide some information for you to follow. <br>


                    A sustainable garden is a winner in the maintenance stakes. It is low maintenance because it needs less mowing, less pruning, fewer chemicals, and less watering. This means you will spend less time maintaining it and more time enjoying it!

                                Compost is a complete DIY plant food and soil conditioner. It is great for soil structure, root growth, soil water-holding capacity, and helps to increase the presence of worms and other beneficial organisms. It turns everything from vacuum cleaner dust to eggshells into free fertilizer. Most importantly, it diverts nutrient-rich organic waste back into your garden, rather than into a landfill site, helping to reduce damaging greenhouse gases. Remember healthy living soil = healthy plants.

                                Even if you don’t have a compost heap or bin, you can still enjoy the marvelous benefits of mulch. Simply spread weed-free dry grass clippings, leaves, and shredded prunings on top of the soil to a depth of 15 cm for course material such as leaves and shredded prunings and only 2.5 cm for fresh grass clippings. Remember to keep the mulch away from plant stems to avoid collar rot.<br><br>

                                Some forms of fertilizer are often expensive, require a lot of water, and may not even be necessary. Check any nutrient deficiency symptoms in foliage with your local nursery. Avoid chemical fertilizers and go organic with your own mulch and compost.
                                Nitrogen-rich fertilizers cause algal blooms and increase weed growth in our waterways. This disturbs the ecological balance for animals and plants that live there. Some native plants, such as banksias and grevilleas, are sensitive to phosphorus so avoid using fertilizers and greywater on these.  <br><br>
