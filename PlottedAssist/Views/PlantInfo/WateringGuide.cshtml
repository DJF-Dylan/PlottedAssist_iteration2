                            When Planting Water plants as soon as you get them in the ground. Allow the water to soak in and drain, and water again, until the soil is thoroughly moistened. Spring through Fall, When Weather is Dry For the first week or so after planting… Water just-planted plants frequently - daily or every other day - as the roots will not be able to access soil moisture from a very large area until they begin to grow. After the first week or so... Unless the weather is extremely hot and dry, you may be able to decrease the watering frequency, perhaps to two or three times per week, for the next month or so.

                            Properly planted and watered, plants should be fairly well established by now, and can thrive with less watering than you may expect. Plants selected for drought tolerance in your conditions may need no supplemental water, whereas shallow-rooted plants or plants with greater water needs may need water weekly. Many plants, when selected for the conditions in your yard and watered according to the above guidelines, may need watering only a couple of times per month in dry weather. Remember that all plants will benefit from deeper and less frequent watering as a general rule.

                            Check them daily during the summer, as containers tend to dry out quickly. On a hot day in full sun, you may need to water twice. To determine whether a container needs water, stick your finger into the soil. If it’s dry down to the first knuckle on your index finger, add water. If the soil is damp, don’t water. Always apply enough water so that some drips out the bottom drain hole. If your plant is wilting or the soil is dry and pulling away from the edge of the pot, your plant needs immediate watering. Place the pot in a bucket or saucer of water, so that it can soak water right up into the soil rather than running around the root ball. The type of potting soil used will affect watering as will the type of container used. Unglazed clay pots typically dry out faster than plastic pots.

                            Preferably don’t water at night. Watering cycles have to be adjusted during the 'night-time' period because plants don’t use as much water as they do during the 'day time'. Don’t forget that the dark cycle is critical to plant development. This holds true for cloudy days or high humidity periods. But do be sure to adjust the irrigation cycle to water in the last or first half-hour of light.
